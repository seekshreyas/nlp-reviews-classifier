line 304 [-4: (negative) correct!]: ##For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!

line 307 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!

line 309 [-3: (negative) ooooooooops!]: WORKS[+2]##SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!

line 310 [-18: (negative) correct!]: Diaper Champ[-1]##Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!

line 311 [-3: (negative) correct!]: ##In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
