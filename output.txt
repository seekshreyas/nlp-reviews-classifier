line 2 [-3: (negative) correct!]: instruction[-2] ##Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 

line 3 [-6: (negative) correct!]: touch-pad[-2], navigate[-3] ##After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 

line 4 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities. 

line 5 [-28: (negative) correct!]: EXPLAIN[-3] ##SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.

line 6 [-4: (negative) correct!]: navigating[-3] ##Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.

line 18 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I just discovered another con in my list of pros and cons.

line 19 [-2: (negative) correct!]: Zen Micro[-2] ##This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.

line 20 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##Ahhh! There is a catch, the manufacturer does not tell you. 

line 21 [-2: (negative) correct!]: store[+2], INSTALL[-2] ##Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!

line 25 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##This brings my review to one star!

line 31 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##1.

line 32 [-2: (negative) correct!]: Button sensitivity[-2] ##) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 

line 33 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. . 

line 34 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##2.

line 35 [-16: (negative) correct!]: FEATURE[-3], recharge cord[-3] ##) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 

line 36 [-4: (negative) correct!]: cost[-3]##You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 

line 37 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer. 

line 38 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer. 

line 39 [-2: (negative) correct!]: charged[-2] ##I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 

line 40 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket. 

line 41 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market. 

line 42 [-2: (negative) correct!]: product[-2] ##I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 

line 43 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord? 

line 44 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.

line 47 [-4: (negative) correct!]: prices[-3] ##) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 

line 48 [-4: (negative) correct!]: case[-2] ##The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.

line 50 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##4.

line 51 [4: (positive) correct!]: battery[+3] ##) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 

line 52 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.

line 54 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##5.

line 55 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired. 

line 56 [1: (positive) correct!]: FM receiver[+1] ##The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 

line 57 [-2: (negative) correct!]: FM receiver[-][cc] ##IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.

line 61 [-2: (negative) correct!]: charges[-2] ##As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     

line 62 [0: (neutral) correct!]: [t]

line 63 [2: (positive) correct!]: Zen Micro[+2] ##Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.

line 64 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##  Why?  

line 65 [8: (positive) correct!]: size[+2], space[+2][u], battery[+2], look[+2]##Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  

line 66 [-4: (negative) correct!]: touchpad[-1] ##The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.

line 67 [4: (positive) correct!]: small[+3] ##I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.

line 73 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##This proprietory software to download. 

line 74 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##(That was a major turn off). 

line 75 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod. 

line 76 [2: (positive) correct!]: player[+2][p] ##Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 

line 77 [-2: (negative) correct!]: ##The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style. 

line 78 [-2: (negative) correct!]: Headphones[-2] ##and supply those stupid white Headphones. 

line 79 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well. 

line 80 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Let's face it. 

line 81 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Apple is Apple.

line 85 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##With so many choices it was a tough decision. 

line 86 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##My first instinct was to go with an iPod. 

line 87 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.  

line 88 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try. 

line 89 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##All I can say is what a wonderful choice! 

line 90 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!  

line 91 [3: (positive) correct!]: small[+3][u] ##Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 

line 92 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up. 

line 93 [4: (positive) correct!]: installation[+3] ##The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 

line 94 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.

line 106 [2: (positive) correct!]: Speakers[+2] ##1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  

line 107 [7: (positive) correct!]: Look[+3], Feel[+3] ##The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience.

line 109 [2: (positive) correct!]: tiny[-1][u], back[+3] ##The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 

line 110 [2: (positive) correct!]: feels[+2][p] ##It feels tiny in the hand without it. 

line 111 [2: (positive) correct!]: stand[+2] ##The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 

line 112 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot. 

line 113 [6: (positive) correct!]: looks[+3], read[+2][u] ##The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 

line 114 [-2: (negative) correct!]: touch controls[-1] ##The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 

line 115 [4: (positive) correct!]: touch buttons[+3] ##The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   

line 116 [3: (positive) correct!]: Build[+3] ##Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 

line 117 [1: (positive) correct!]: hardcase[+1] ##The hardcase they give with it must work well.

line 119 [3: (positive) correct!]: sound[+3] ##Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.

line 122 [3: (positive) correct!]: features[+3] ##Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 

line 123 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book. 

line 124 [4: (positive) correct!]: recorded[+3] ##The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 

line 125 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  

line 126 [-2: (negative) correct!]: software[-1] ##Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 

line 127 [4: (positive) correct!]: playlists[+3] ##Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  

line 128 [-2: (negative) correct!]: battery life[-2] ##There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 

line 129 [-4: (negative) correct!]: USB[-2] ##Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.

line 136 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##i havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.  

line 137 [-2: (negative) correct!]: organization[-2][u] ##i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  

line 138 [-2: (negative) correct!]: ##in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.  

line 139 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##and if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.

line 146 [0: (neutral) correct!]: [t]

line 147 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis. 

line 148 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod. 

line 149 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Bottom line.  

line 150 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod. 

line 151 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##For whatever reason. There is also a low number of people, like me, who love iTunes but want to get the Zen Micro. 

line 152 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I'll talk more about that later.  

line 153 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##First of all, why does every single piece of media library software that comes with an MP3 player suck? 

line 154 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##(iTunes being an exception of course). 

line 155 [-3: (negative) correct!]: software[-2], feature[-2][u] ##The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 

line 156 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain. 

line 157 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.  

line 158 [-2: (negative) correct!]: Player[-1] ##NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  

line 159 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##1.

line 160 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.

line 181 [1: (positive) correct!]: iTunes[+1] ##I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   

line 182 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list. 

line 183 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##After that, you connect your Zen Micro and open My Computer. 

line 184 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Click on "Zen Micro Media Explorer" and then click on "Transfer Data Between PC and Device" after that, a File Explorer window opens. 

line 185 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.  

line 186 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##It's not as seamless as if you were to use an iPod, but it only takes a few seconds longer. 

line 187 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##So yeah, you can have the best of both worlds.  

line 188 [-2: (negative) correct!]: ##* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work. 

line 189 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.  

line 190 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##**I honestly don't see the point of buying songs from iTunes when there are so many free alternatives. 

line 191 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.

line 201 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go". 

line 202 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##So that's the one I bought. 

line 203 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##Too bad.  

line 204 [-4: (negative) correct!]: made[-3][u] ##First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.

line 207 [-7: (negative) correct!]: eq[-3], bass[-3] ##The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 

line 208 [0: (neutral) correct!]: volume [-1] ##Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 

line 209 [-3: (negative) correct!]: headphone jack[-3] ##The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.

line 214 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Hands down, better quality than ipod's.

line 216 [-2: (negative) correct!]: storage[-2][u] ##Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 

line 217 [-2: (negative) correct!]: storage[-2][u] ##I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   

line 218 [-2: (negative) correct!]: ##If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.   ##Otherwise, you should get an ipod. 

line 219 [-2: (negative) correct!]: creative[-][cc]##My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.

line 220 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##features[-][u][cc]It hold's a promised amount of songs, and the headphone jack/volume controls deliver a more impressive performance than creative's.   

line 221 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive. 

line 222 [-1: (negative) correct!]: ##player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.

line 224 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players. 

line 225 [2: (positive) correct!]: compatibility with windows media player[+3]  ##While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 

line 226 [2: (positive) correct!]: format[+2] ##Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.

line 230 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.   

line 231 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.

line 234 [3: (positive) correct!]: size[+2],feel[+2] ##The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 

line 235 [5: (positive) correct!]: backlight[+3] ##The blue backlight is pretty cool. 

line 236 [4: (positive) correct!]: screen[+2], touchpad[+2] ##The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  

line 237 [9: (positive) correct!]: sound[+3], audio quality[+3] ##- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 

line 238 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.   

line 239 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##- Integration with Media Player. 

line 240 [2: (positive) correct!]: transfer[+2], sync with media player[+1][u] ##The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  

line 241 [1: (positive) correct!]: battery[+1] ##- Replaceable battery. 

line 242 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.

line 247 [2: (positive) correct!]: interface[+2][u] ##With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  

line 248 [3: (positive) correct!]: player[+3][p] ##I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  

line 249 [-3: (negative) correct!]: battery life[-2] ##The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 

line 250 [1: (positive) correct!]: ##Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware. 

line 251 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon. 

line 252 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##For me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight. 

line 253 [-3: (negative) correct!]: battery life[-2] ##Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.

line 269 [-1: (negative) correct!]: touchpad[-1] ##I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).

line 292 [0: (neutral) correct!]: ##Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
